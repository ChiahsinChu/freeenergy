\section{Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics\label{Sec:ES:REMD}}
Temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (T-REMD) is one class of parallel tempering methods developed by Sugita and Okamoto in 1999.\cite{SugitaCPL1999} It is an extension of the well-known simulation annealing method. 


Another type of REMD simulation is called Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (H-REMD), in which the replicas have different Hamiltonians but the same temperature. 

The third type of REMD simulation duplicates the system by alternating the species of the system. A typical example is pH-REMD, in which each replica is coupled with different pH of the solution. Therefore, the protonation state (or probabilities of protonation and deprotonation) of each replica may differ from those of other replicas.
