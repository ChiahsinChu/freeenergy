Computer simulations of biological system have made much progress in the past decades. 

We are still facing many difficulties in three aspects, i.e. Hamiltonians, sampling efficiency and postprocessing methods.\cite{NielsJCTC2014}

Recently, there is one special issue focusing on the methodologies of free energy calculations on Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (Free Energy Calculations: Three Decades of Adventure in Chemistry and Biophysics, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, Volume 10, Issue 7, 2014). There are also two books on this topic you might be interested in:
